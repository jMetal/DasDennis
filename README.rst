DasDennis Project (Version 1.0)
===============================

This project contains a Python implementation of the Das-Dennis algorithm to get a uniformly distributed set of
weight vectors.

The files included in the project are briefly described next:

* ``das_dennys.py``: Python file defining the ``DasDennis`` class.
* ``das_dennys_runner.py``: Python program including an example of using the ``DasDennis`` class to generate a set of weight vectors with values for number of partitions and dimensions of 5 and 3, respectively.
* ``DasDennisExamplesNotebook.ipynb``: Jupyter notebook illustrating the use of the ``DasDennis`` class.
* ``DasDenninsDevelop.ipynb``. Jupyter notebook used in the development of the implementation.
* ``test_das_dennis.py``: Python file including unit tests for the ``DasDennis`` class.
